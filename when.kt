// Instead of writing many if..else expressions, you can use the when expression, which is much easier to read

val day = 4

val result = when (day) {
  1 -> "Monday"
  2 -> "Tuesday"
  3 -> "Wednesday"
  4 -> "Thursday"
  5 -> "Friday"
  6 -> "Saturday"
  7 -> "Sunday"
  else -> "Invalid day."
}
println(result)

// outputs "Thursday" (day 4)
